NOTES 

- The "captions.json" file will store captions for individual images. You may enter captions manually before running the script, or wait for the script to prompt you. 

- When running the script, if a caption is not found for a specific image, it will prompt you to enter a caption. If you do not enter one, it will leave the caption blank. 

- You may edit the "captions.json" file at any time to change a caption. Re-run the script after making any changes. 

- Gallery thumbnail photos are created at a 200x200 size. 

- Profile photos on the “People” page should be 200x200 size.

- If your photo appears in the wrong orientation, it’s because that the web browser cannot read the EXIF data from the photo. It displays in the original orientation because it does not know that you have edited it. Open the original photo on your computer and “Export” a new version of the same photo. This will give it the desired orientation as an original property of the photo.
