					<h3>Project goals</h3>
					<p>Humans are altering our climate system. The arctic is warming faster than the rest of the planet. Alaska offers an excellent natural laboratory to evaluate changes in the climate system. It also offers a way to understand Earth’s climate in the recent past. For this reason, we are focusing our research in three glaciated regions in the Arctic.</p>

					<p>The glaciated watersheds fall along an environmental gradient spanning from the sub-Arctic to the High Arctic, including Lake Linne (Svalbard), Lake Peters (near McCall Glacier, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge), and Eklutna Lake (near Anchorage, Alaska).</p>

					<p>Lake sediments contain the record of past environmental conditions. We use sediments to understand how major features of the Arctic system vary on seasonal to millennial time scales. Sediments also provide an insight into how the Arctic will respond to natural and anthropogenic forcing.</p>

					<p>Lakes in glaciated watersheds also record changes in the melt rate of upstream glaciers, which are among the most dynamic components of the evolving Arctic system. The sediment stored in glacier-fed lakes often contains distinct rhythmic layers that represent annual cycles.</p>

					<p>During this project, we will collaborate with utility managers of the Municipality of Anchorage who are planning for diminished glacier meltwater input to Eklutna Lake, a major source of their electricity and freshwater for the region. We also will collaborate with resource managers at U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who are developing a monitoring network for the Arctic Refuge to prepare for future changes in habitat quality associated with glacier retreat.</p>

					<p>Lakes in glaciated watersheds also record changes in the melt rate of upstream glaciers, which are among the most dynamic components of the evolving Arctic system. The sediment stored in glacier-fed lakes often comprise distinct rhythmic layers that represent annual cycles.</p>
					<p>This project will develop the first system model to simulate the full chain of processes that control how weather and climate are filtered via the glacier-hydrology-lake-sedimentation system and are recorded in physical components of lake deposits in glaciated catchments. The project includes a major field-based initiative to provide the input data to run the system model and to ground-truth its output. This forward model provides a complementary alternative approach to inverse models traditionally used by paleo-limnologists to infer past climate variability from lake sediment.</p>
